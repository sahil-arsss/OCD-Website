      <h3>
        Welcome to the OpenCode Developer Society (OCD), where passion meets innovation!
        Approved by our esteemed professors, we're a student-driven community at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra dedicated to empowering tech enthusiasts.
        We foster a collaborative environment where members can refine their problem-solving skills 
        and learn from each other's approaches through daily DSA discussions, 
        CP discussions, and Development Projects, thereby promoting mutual growth and innovation.
      </h3>
      </h3>
      <h3>What We Offer:</h3>

      <h2>Comprehensive Resources:</h2>
      Dive into an array of resources tailored to help you explore and excel in your favorite tech fields. In our 'Resources' section, you'll find a plethora of resources, including books, courses, and tutorials, to help you get started. From beginner to advanced, we've got you covered with latest coding contest rounds, coding platforms, and much more.
      Our induction process is designed to be unlike any other, setting a new standard in onboarding and skill development.

      <h2>Core Team Projects:</h2>
      Post-induction, join a dynamic core team focused on projects destined for production, ensuring significant enhancements to your resume. Our development initiatives are designed to empower members to take ownership of their projects 
      and explore new technologies and ideas under the guidance of experienced seniors. 
      We take pride in the fact that our website is developed entirely by our own members, 
      demonstrating our commitment to hands-on experience and collaborative learning. 
      Our two major projects, NoterAI and CPMasters, are testaments to our dedication to innovation 
      and providing a platform for members to develop real-world software development skills.

      <h2>Mentorship:</h2>
      Second and third-year members will mentor new juniors, fostering a collaborative environment for project development and research.
      The ongoing projects at OCD are mentored by dedicated seniors who provide guidance and support to the members. Under their mentorship, many members have made their first pull request (PR) and gained valuable experience in real-world software development. This mentorship program fosters a collaborative environment where members can learn from experienced seniors and contribute to meaningful projects. It serves as a platform for skill development and encourages members to explore new technologies and ideas.


      <h2>Opportunities:</h2>
        By joining our society, you'll have the opportunity to participate in hackathons and coding contests, showcasing your skills and competing with other talented individuals. You'll also have the chance to build projects that solve real-world problems, adding them to your resume and demonstrating your practical experience and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with professors on cutting-edge research, with chances for publication, allowing you to contribute to the academic community. Under the guidance of experienced seniors, you'll work on development initiatives, gaining valuable industry exposure and mentorship. Through hands-on learning, you'll take ownership of your projects, exploring new technologies and ideas, and developing a portfolio of work that showcases your skills and expertise.

      <h2>Challenges and Initiatives:</h2>
      The society continuously introduces new challenges to keep the atmosphere dynamic and engaging. Our recent #30DaysOfJavaScript challenge saw an impressive participation of over 50 dedicated members. We also regularly host informative meetings, where our seniors generously share their knowledge and provide invaluable guidance. Engage in hackathons throughout the year and work on projects that solve real-world problems and build products people use. Join us in building meaningful, impactful projects that go beyond the ordinary.
